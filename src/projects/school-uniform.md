subtitle: Making it easy to share good quality, second hand uniform across Leeds
  and reduce the amount that goes to waste.
intro:
  - title: What we’re doing
    content: We’ve set up Leeds School Uniform Exchange - making it as easy as
      possible for people across Leeds to share good quality second hand school
      uniform.  You can find out more - including where your nearest exchange is
      - on our [website](https://leedsuniformexchange.org.uk/).
  - title: Why we’re doing it
    content: In September 2018 we were having conversations about how some families
      in Leeds couldn’t afford school uniform - and at the same time we came
      across a school so overwhelmed with lost property that they were throwing
      it in a skip. Put those two things together and Leeds School Uniform
      Exchange is the result!

    description: Every year, global emissions from textile production are equivalent
      to 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2, a figure that outweighs the carbon footprint
      of international flights and shipping combined.
