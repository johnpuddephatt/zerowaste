intro:
  - title: What we’re doing
    content: >-
      We’ve set up Leeds Winter Coat Appeal to make it easy for people across Leeds to donate, share and collect good quality second hand winter coats. So far this winter we've collected and distributed 3600 coats. Demand is really high so we need your help to collect more.

  - title: Why we’re doing it
    content: >-
      Leeds is a generous city, people are willing to share what they have. Last summer we distributed over 12,000 items of second hand, donated school uniform to over 1,000 families, saving them over £200,000 - which they can then spend on other essentials. Now we want to do the same with coats, hats, scarves and gloves.

      By redistributing winter coats across the city we will help to ensure that fewer people in Leeds go without a warm coat this winter. We will also help to reduce waste by encouraging people to share the coats they no longer use rather than throwing them away - it makes sense and is good for the environment.
