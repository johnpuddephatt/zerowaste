    content: >-
      We’ve set up Leeds Winter Coat Appeal to make it easy for people across
      Leeds to donate, share and collect good quality second hand winter coats.
      The appeal launches on 21 October 2024 and will continue until the end of
      January 2025 - with all coats being distributed to local families by the
      end of February 2025.


      Last year's Appeal was a huge success thanks to the many businesses, individuals and community groups that got involved donating and distributing coats.  We were able to give out over 7,600 items of winter clothing to families for free.  That saved people over £144,000 - money that stayed within the family budget and could be spent on other essentials.  The rising cost of food, utilities and other living costs is hitting people hard and it's especially difficult over the cold winter months.


      **Donations welcome from 21 October 2024 - 31 January 2025. [Find your nearest drop-off point here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F08UeFw0pxEW2CuWIHKc8UWeDNsFr5tQ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111174684810694430309&rtpof=true&sd=true)**

      Free coats will be available from 4 November 2024 until 28 February 2025. [Find your nearest collection point here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wvrv4qIub561Q71WLciZZ1RC5etxzeQl/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111174684810694430309&rtpof=true&sd=true)
  - title: Why we’re doing it
    content: >-
      Leeds is a very generous city and we are so thankful that people can and
      want to help.  From September 2023 to September 2024 we distributed over
      22,800 items of second hand, donated school uniform to over 3,600
      families, saving them over £388,900 - which they can then spend on other
      essentials. Now we want to do the same with coats, hats, scarves and
      gloves.


      This year we'd like people to share the winter coats they no longer want or need.  It's such a great way to come together as a community and share the things we have.  By redistributing winter coats across the city we will help to ensure that fewer people in Leeds go without a warm coat this winter. We will also help to reduce waste by encouraging people to share the coats they no longer use rather than throwing them away - it makes sense and is good for the environment.
