    content: >-
      We’ve set up Leeds Winter Coat Appeal to make it easy for people across
      Leeds to donate, share and collect good quality second hand winter coats.
      The appeal launched on 20 October 2025 and will continue until the end of
      January 2026 - with all coats being distributed to local families by the
      end of February 2026.


      Last year's Appeal was a huge success thanks to the many businesses, individuals and community groups that got involved donating and distributing coats.  Last year we were able to give out 8,900 items of winter clothing to families in Leeds for FREE.  That saved people over £272,800 - money that stayed in the family budget and could be spent on other essentials. The rising cost of food, utilities and other living costs is hitting people hard and it's especially difficult over the cold winter months.


      **Donations welcome from 20 October 2025 - 30 January 2026.** [Find your nearest drop-off point here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VvlVIPEkKCfaKLwdKzmAYRpE0uu_DSE3)

      Free coats will be available a various distribution points across Leeds in early November 2025. A full list will be uploaded shortly.
  - title: Why we’re doing it
    content: >-
      Leeds is a very generous city and we are so thankful that people can and
      want to help.  From September 2024 to September 2025 we distributed over
      26,850 items of second hand, donated school uniform to over 3,800
      families, saving them over £402,750 - which they can then spend on other
      essentials. Now we want to do the same with coats, hats, scarves and
      gloves.


      This year we'd like people to share the winter coats they no longer want or need.  It's such a great way to come together as a community and share the things we have.  By redistributing winter coats across the city we will help to ensure that fewer people in Leeds go without a warm coat this winter. We will also help to reduce waste by encouraging people to share the coats they no longer use rather than throwing them away - it makes sense and is good for the environment.
