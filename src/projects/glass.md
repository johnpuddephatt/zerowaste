intro:
  - title: What we’re doing
    content: We want recycling glass to be something that everyone in the city does
      and for them to know how it makes a difference.   We spent some time
      exploring the reasons why some people don’t recycle their glass which
      helped us to find solutions and ways to make it easier.  We’ve pulled
      together our top glass recycling tips, including a useful map to find your
      nearest glass bank, as well as some interesting facts about the glass
      industry in Yorkshire.
  - title: Why we’re doing it
    content: In Leeds we throw away 4000 tonnes of clothing into our household bins
      every year.  There are much better choices for our clothes at the end of
      life but waste is just one part of the story.  The textile industry is
      responsible for 10% of carbon emissions, a massive environmental impact.
      Protecting our planet for future generations is important and when it
      comes to clothes, there's plenty we can all do. Most are fun too like
      learning how to sew, clothes swapping with friends, upcycling a favourite
      item or doing a wardrobe audit before buying anything new.
