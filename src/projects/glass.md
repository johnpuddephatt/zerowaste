intro:
  - title: What we’re doing
    content: We want recycling glass to be something that everyone in the city does
      and for them to understand the difference it makes.   We spent some time
      exploring the reasons why some people don’t recycle their glass which
      helped us to find solutions and ways to make it easier.  We’ve pulled
      together our top glass recycling tips, including a useful map to find your
      nearest glass bank, as well as some interesting facts about the glass
      industry in Yorkshire.
  - title: Why we’re doing it
    content: Last year the people of Leeds recycled 37% more glass than the previous
      year.  We think that’s amazing! We want to build on that success and
      continue to increase the amount of glass recycled in Leeds. Why? Using
      recycled glass bottles and jars to make new glass is much more
      environmentally friendly - the temperature in the furnace doesn’t need to
      be quite so high and no CO2 is given off.  It also helps to support a
      thriving local Yorkshire circular glass economy.
