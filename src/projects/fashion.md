subtitle: Building a circular city where we value our clothes, wear them for as
  long as possible, repair, upcycle and when we no longer want them, find people
  or places that do.

intro:
  - title: What we’re doing
    content: Many of us want to make more sustainable clothing choices but don’t
      know where to start. We’ve launched Leeds Fashion Futures to explore how
      as a city we can do that. We’ve looked at what makes Leeds unique and
      spoken to the many people involved in clothing and textiles. Valuing our
      clothes was a major theme, plus Leeds' rich textile heritage, and the
      importance of sewing skills. Here we share a bit of all of that, plus
      some practical tips and ideas.
  - title: Why we’re doing it
    content:
      In Leeds we throw away 4000 tonnes of clothing into our household bins
      every year. There are much better choices for our clothes at the end of
      life but waste is just one part of the story. The textile industry is
      responsible for 10% of carbon emissions, a massive environmental impact.
      Protecting our planet for future generations is important and when it
      comes to clothes, there's plenty we can all do. Most are fun too like
      learning how to sew, clothes swapping with friends, upcycling a favourite
      item or doing a wardrobe audit before buying anything new.

      to 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2, a figure that outweighs the carbon footprint
