subtitle: Building a circular city where we value our clothes, wear them for as
  long as possible, repair, upcycle and when we no longer want them, we find
  people or places that do.

intro:
  - title: What we’re doing
    content: >-
      We’re making it easier for people in Leeds to make clothing choices that
      are good for the planet.  We do that by sharing the most high impact
      actions you can take as an individual and collectively. 


      We’ll guide you to the all the places and events happening in Leeds where you can repair, reuse, upcycle and exchange or share your clothes, including school uniform.  Doing these things brings us closer to becoming a Circular City where clothing is redistributed, much less is wasted, making it better for our pockets and the planet.
  - title: Why we’re doing it
    content: The textile industry is responsible for 10% of carbon emissions, a
      massive environmental impact. Protecting our planet for future generations
      is important and when it comes to clothes, there's plenty we can do
      individually and collectively.  Most are fun too like clothes swapping or
      learning how to sew with friends, using community exchange schemes, or
      doing a wardrobe audit before buying anything new.  Let's work together to
      divert some of the 4000 tonnes of clothing that ends up in Leeds'
      household bins every year and circulate the best of it back around the
      city.
