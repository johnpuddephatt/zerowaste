intro:
  - title: What we’re doing
    content: Many of us want to make clothing choices that are kinder to the planet
      but don’t know where to start. We’ve launched Leeds Fashion Futures in
      partnership with The RSA to explore how as a city we can do that.  We’ve
      looked at what makes Leeds unique and spoken to the many people involved
      in clothing, textiles and fashion.  Valuing our clothes was a major theme,
      plus Leeds' rich textile heritage, and the importance of sewing
      skills.  Here we share a bit of all of that, plus some practical tips and
      ideas.
  - title: Why we’re doing it
    content: In Leeds we throw away 4000 tonnes of clothing into our household bins
      every year.  There are much better choices for our clothes at the end of
      life but waste is just one part of the story.  The textile industry is
      responsible for 8% of carbon emissions, a massive environmental
      impact.  With so much greenwashing it can be hard to unpick what is and
      isn't a sustainable choice.  Leeds Fashion Futures aims to help with that.

    description: Every year, global emissions from textile production are equivalent
      to 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2, a figure that outweighs the carbon footprint
      of international flights and shipping combined.
