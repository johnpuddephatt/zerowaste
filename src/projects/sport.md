intro:
  - title: What we’re doing
    content: We’ve set up Together for Sport to make it as easy as possible for
      people across Leeds to share good quality second hand sport kit and
      equipment.  We’re developing a map where you will be able to find out
      about sport clubs that have joined the Together for Sport community and
      you can start exchanging now by offering the kit you have or asking for
      the kit you need on our Facebook Page.
  - title: Why we’re doing it
    content: >-
      Sport kit and equipment is expensive and, for some people, it’s the
      biggest barrier to taking part.  Being active is so good for both our
      physical and mental wellbeing and by working with local people to open up
      a supply of kit we can save waste, save money and feel good!

      **What do we mean by sport?** We mean every sport and activity from golf to tap dancing to running, from football to snooker, gymnastics, climbing, walking and gym work.
