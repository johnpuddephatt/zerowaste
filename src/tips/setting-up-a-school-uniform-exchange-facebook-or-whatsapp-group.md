One of the simplest ways to start a uniform reuse scheme at your school is to use an existing parent Facebook/WhatsApp group or create a new group solely for uniform exchange.

Both of these options are easy and encourage people to organise the uniform exchanging between themselves so shouldnâ€™t be too time consuming.

We've created this [guide](https://issuu.com/zerowasteleeds/docs/how_to_guide_-_facebook_or_whatsapp__6_) to help you get started. If you have any suggestions or feedback on the guide please [get in touch](mailto:info@zerowasteleeds.org.uk).

If you have a bit more time to give, you could also use a Facebook page or group to advertise a more hands-on uniform redistribution scheme i.e. one where you collect, store and redistribute uniform. See the full distribution guide [here](https://issuu.com/zerowasteleeds/docs/school_community_group_or_involved_parent).

Please also [get in touch](mailto:info@zerowasteleeds.org.uk) if you need any other help in setting up a uniform reuse scheme. There is also the Leeds School Uniform Exchange [website](https://leedsuniformexchange.org.uk/) and [](https://www.facebook.com/groups/603050533660854/)[Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/603050533660854) where you can find schemes, ask for advice or advertise a new scheme.

Before you go ahead and set up a new school uniform exchange scheme, it is also worth checking our [map](https://leedsuniformexchange.org.uk/map/) and also asking the school and PTA if they are aware of a school uniform reuse scheme already in place. If you find a scheme that is not already on our map, please let us know [here](https://leedsuniformexchange.org.uk/contact/).
