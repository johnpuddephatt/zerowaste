One of the simplest ways to start a uniform reuse scheme at your school is to use an existing parent Facebook or WhatsApp group or create a new group solely for uniform exchange. 

Both of these options are easy and encourage people to organise the uniform exchanging between themselves so shouldnâ€™t be too time consuming.

If you have a bit more time to give, you could also use a Facebook page or group to advertise a more hands-on uniform redistribution scheme.

We've created the [inspiration guide](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEEkQESk8Y/view?utm_content=DAEEkQESk8Y&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=embeds&utm_source=link) below to help you get started. Please [get in touch](mailto:info@zerowasteleeds.org.uk) if you need any help getting started.

Before you do set up a new school uniform exchange scheme, it is also worth checking our map [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?hl=en&mid=12f68wxlwJ-MdovH7aQRHCwJyBDkWn-v3&ll=0%2C0&z=11) and also asking the school and PTA if they are aware of a school uniform reuse scheme already in place. If you find a scheme that is not already on our map, please let us know using this [form](https://forms.gle/TbbcxuSpPPgczCth8).
