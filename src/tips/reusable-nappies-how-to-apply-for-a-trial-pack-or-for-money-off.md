Did you know that a baby can get through the equivalent of 12 wheelie bins of disposable nappies in just one year?!

If you're having a baby and are interested in how you can keep waste to a minimum, then it's certainly worth considering reusable nappies.

They've come a long way from the bulky terry nappies and big safety pins that some of us may remember from long ago.

There are plenty of brands out there to choose from - and feedback from parents suggests that they can be much more user-friendly than they used to be.

If you live in Leeds, you can apply for support from Leeds City Council - either to get a trial pack which includes two reusable nappies, or to get £30 towards the purchase price (minimum spend £50) of some reusable nappies.

You can find out more and apply on [the Council's website](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/reduce-your-waste).  

Further support is also available via [Leeds Cloth Nappy Library](https://www.facebook.com/LeedsClothNappyLibrary/).  

There's chat about real nappies - including some suggestions on brands that people have found to be good - on [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds/posts/908905589667965).
