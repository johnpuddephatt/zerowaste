Did you know that a baby can get through the equivalent of 12 wheelie bins of disposable nappies in just one year?!

If you're having a baby and are interested in how you can keep waste to a minimum, then it's certainly worth considering reusable nappies.

They've come a long way from the bulky terry nappies and big safety pins that some of us may remember from long ago.

There are plenty of brands out there to choose from - and feedback from parents suggests that they can be much more user-friendly than they used to be.

If you live in Leeds, check out the [Leeds Cloth Nappy Library](https://www.facebook.com/LeedsClothNappyLibrary/). Set up in 2012, they provide support to cloth nappy users and have a lending facility available, a great starting point for advice if you are considering to make the switch from disposable nappies to reusable ones.
