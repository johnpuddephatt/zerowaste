## check out our list of resources to help you buy package free fruit and vegetables

We are trying to move away from supermarket bought fruit and vegetables to supporting local businesses and ordering weekly baskets.

We have been so impressed by the quality, value for money and speed of delivery and the best part is that the fruit and vegetables come loose in the cardboard which means less packaging waste.
