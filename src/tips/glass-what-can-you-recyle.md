## Types of glass I can recycle

Bottles of any colour - wine, beer, spirits, soft drinks

Jars of any colour - jam/marmalade, sauces, spreads (eg Nutella, Marmite, sandwich spread), baby food

Other glass - Perfume/aftershave, beauty product glass containers (eg face creams) of any colour

# How to recycle

* Give your bottles and jars a quick rinse.  Empty out all the liquid. 
* Put metal lids and bottle tops back on.  They will be taken out in the sorting process and recycled separately.  
* Put your bottles and jars in a reusable bag or box, ready to take to one of the 377 glass bank sites across the city.  
* Find your closest glass recycling site on our [glass bank map](https://glass.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/#/).  Many of us are within 500 metres of one - just a third of a mile. 
* Put your glass in any of the glass banks. There is no need to colour sort it - that will be done by a clever machine at [the recycling plant in Knottingley](https://www.urmgroup.co.uk/about-us/).   
* Take your boxes/bags back home with you to reuse next time.
