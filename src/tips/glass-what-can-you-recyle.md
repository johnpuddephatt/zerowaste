### How to recycle 

![](/uploads/1-100.jpg)

\- Give your bottles and jars a quick rinse.  Empty out all the liquid. 

\- Put the lids and bottle tops back on.  They will be taken out in the sorting process and recycled separately.  

\- Put your bottles and jars in a reusable bag or box, ready to take to one of the 377 glass bank sites across the city.  Find your closest one on our glass bank map (LINK). 

\- No need to colour sort your glass.  Just put it in any of the glass banks.  It will be sorted at the recycling plant.   

\- Take your boxes/bags back home with you to reuse next time.  

THANK YOU FOR RECYCLING YOUR GLASS!
