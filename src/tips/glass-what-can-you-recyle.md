In Leeds last year we recycled 37% more glass than the year before. Nice one Leeds!  Let's keep on recycling. 

## Types of glass I can recycle

Bottles of any colour - wine, beer, spirits, soft drinks

Jars of any colour - jam/marmalade, sauces, spreads (eg Nutella, Marmite, sandwich spread), baby food

Other glass - Perfume/aftershave, beauty product glass containers (eg face creams) of any colour 

## **Glass that can't be recycled**

Glass cookware - pyrex, microwave dishes

Drinking glasses

Vases and decorative glass ornaments

Nail varnish bottles

Candle jars/reed diffuser bottles

Mirrors

Light bulbs and tubes 

Medicine bottles (eg Calpol/Nurofen) 

Ceramics - crockery/earthenware

## How to recycle

* Give your bottles and jars a quick rinse.  Empty out all the liquid. 
* Put lids and bottle tops back on.  They will be taken out in the sorting process and recycled separately.  Remove any corks from bottles and put them in your green household waste recycling bin. 
* Put your bottles and jars in a reusable bag or box, ready to take to one of the 377 glass bank sites across the city.  
* Find your closest glass recycling site on our glass bank map (LINK).  Most people are within 500m of one - just a third of a mile. 
* Put your glass in any of the glass banks. There is no need to colour sort it - that will be done at the recycling plant.   
* Take your boxes/bags back home with you to reuse next time.
