According to a recent survey from WRAP, UK households adopted more ‘food smart’ behaviours and created less food waste during the lockdowns. The report shows how many adopted new shopping habits including going to the shops less and checking cupboards more often before setting off to the supermarket.

Let's keep this downward trend going post lockdown by being food savvy. Here's are a few top tips to reduce food waste.

## Check what you already have in

Have a rummage through your fridge, freezer and cupboards. Tidy them up, and make a list of what’s in there.

## Come up with a meal plan

Based on what’s in your cupboards, fridge and freezer, make a plan for the week’s meals. There are loads of ideas online from people like Jack Monroe and Jamie Oliver.

## Make a shopping list 

With all of us being asked to limit our shopping and only shop for essentials, it helps more than ever to shop from a list. Only buy what you need and eat what you buy.

## Compost food scraps 

If you have one, use your compost heap for uncooked fruit and vegetable scraps. If not, now is a perfect time to start one! We have more tips on how to start a compost heap [here](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/tips/top-tips-on-starting-a-compost-heap-at-home/).

## Freeze your food 

Make use of your freezer to preserve fresh food. Most vegetables and fruit can be easily prepared and frozen.

## Make a preserve 

You could make a jam or preserve with your fresh fruit or vegetables to prevent them going off.

## Get the kids involved 

Cooking and meal planning can be a fun activity for kids and is also learning for them whilst they're not at school.
