With the festive season fast approaching, our thoughts at Zero Waste Leeds are turning to how we can all have a fun festive season - where we waste as little as we possibly can.

Of course it's a time of year when we tend to consume more - from food and drink through to gifts for friends and family.

And we don't want to take on the role of Scrooge - particularly in the challenging times we're living through.  We all need the joy that festive celebrations can bring!

But of course, we know that the things we choose to buy, and what we choose to do with stuff we no longer need, can have massive environmental impacts.

And with Christmas being a period when consumption shoots up, there can be all sorts of negative environmental impacts.  That's not good, at a time when we're working out how best to tackle the Climate Emergency.
