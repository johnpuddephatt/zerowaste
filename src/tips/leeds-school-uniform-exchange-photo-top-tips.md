**In the last few months, it's been great to see so much online exchanging of school uniform. We've found that a good quality photo can really help to gain interest in the items being offered. Here are a few of our top tips!**

## **Do** present clothes well

Try to present clothes in the best way possible. Ironing them and hanging them up can make a world of difference!

## **Do** take photos in natural daylight

Wherever possible, try to take photos in natural daylight to show the condition and colour of the item as accurately as possible.

## **Do** make it clear what you are giving away

Try not to display too many items in one photo. You can always upload separate photos on the listing if you are selling multiple items. We would suggest that no more than two items per photo is best.

## Do take photos with a simple background

Try to take photos with a simple background to help the item stand out. Having clutter around can distract from the item.

## **Do make sure items are in good condition**

Before you offer uniform items, please check that they are in good condition. For example, make sure there are no stains, tears or discolourations. We suggest only putting up items you would be happy to receive. If there is minor damage you could always consider options to repair it or if that is not possible you can recycle the uniform item in one of the textile banks shown on this [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?hl=en&mid=18ktKdUeew3oQpjOnezeTyLtt9pk1KK7w&ll=53.83676365656107%2C-1.5013154999999268&z=11).
