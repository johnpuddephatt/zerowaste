**A good photo can help...**

## **Do** present clothes well 

Try not to take photos of items that are overly creased. They are much more likely to go if they are well presented e.g. ironed and hung up.

## **Do** take photos in natural daylight

**Don't** photograph items in dark lighting. They can look much better hung up and in natural daylight.

## **Do** make it clear what you are giving away

Don't have too many items in one photo. Use separate photos on the listing to make it clear.

## \
Do take photos with plain backgrounds

Try not to take photos with a lot of mess around. It can distract from the items.

## **Do make sure items are in good condition**

**Don't** put up items if they are too discoloured or damaged. Only put up items you would be happy to receive.
