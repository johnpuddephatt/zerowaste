The Leeds School Uniform Exchange (LSUE) is making it easy for families to access great quality, second-hand uniform for free, helping them save money whilst also being kinder to the planet. 

This summer has been a busy one where we supported, promoted and helped to run **98** uniform pop up shops across Leeds from June to the end of August 2023, 165% more than last year.

We’re delighted to report that **16,714** items of uniform were given out for free this summer, which is an increase of 35% from last year, and we helped **2,937** families. By providing free uniform to these families, it’s estimated that we saved Leeds families **£284,138**, which has been a huge help in this current cost of living crisis – the money saved from not having to buy uniform could be spent on other essentials.

Not only have we saved families money, but we have also done our bit for the environment too. By reducing the need to produce new uniform we estimate that **60,170kg** CO2 emissions has been saved, that is the equivalent amount of CO2 produced from driving around the world 12.5 times!

We couldn’t have done this without the support of our funders, Leeds City Council, and the passion and dedication of the other school uniform exchanges that are set up in our area – most of which are run by volunteers. In addition, we’d like to say a massive thank you to Active Leeds who helped in our donation drive by having uniform donation bins at Garforth, Holt Park, Morley and Wetherby Leisure Centres.

Please do take a look at our [Impact Report](https://leedsuniformexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/LSUE-Impact-Report-Summer-2023.pdf), it’s an impressive read.

Our work doesn’t stop there though, currently 81% of Leeds schools are covered by a uniform exchange and whilst we’re delighted that 30 new exchanges have been set up since January 2023, 60% of them being in priority areas, we are keen for more schools to be covered. So if you’re school doesn’t have a uniform exchange and you’d like to know how to set one up, please get in touch at info@zerowasteleeds.org.uk and we’ll gladly help.
