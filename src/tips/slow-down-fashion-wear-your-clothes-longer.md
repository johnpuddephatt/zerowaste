Around 30% of clothes in UK wardrobes has not been worn for at least a year.  All those clothes sitting there unloved. 

We’re buying more than ever too – on average 13 items of new clothing every month! So how can we slow down our fast fashion habits? One good way is to value the clothes we have and wear them for longer. 


It’s easy to forget that every new item of clothing we buy is adding to the overall carbon footprint of the fashion industry which is already very significant – around 10% of global carbon emissions. 


You’ll see from the chart below that materials production so the growing of crops or making of synthetic materials that the vast majority of clothes are now made from is one of the biggest contributor of emissions.

What you do matters

It’s true. According to a recent study by Leeds University academic, Dr Mark Sumner, if we all extended the use of our clothes by just nine months, therefore delaying the purchase of new clothes, we could reduce the carbon footprint by 8%. 

1. Do the ‘will I wear it 30 times test’? So we’re starting pre-purchase.  If you don’t think you’ll wear it this amount of times then don’t buy it.  This particularly applies to buying new clothes which have a significant carbon footprint.  Buying second-hand opens up more options but do you really want your wardrobe crammed full of things that aren’t quite right?

> The most sustainable item of clothing is the one already in your wardrobe. 

2. Repair/upcycle your clothes.  Learn how to do some basic clothing repairs like sewing buttons back on, taking up hems, mending small holes.  If you don’t fancy sewing, then do a quick de-bobble! You’ll be surprised at how many of your clothes you can get looking their best again after a de-bobbling session.  If enjoy sewing then, upcycling opens up a whole new world and means you can refashion your clothes instantly.
