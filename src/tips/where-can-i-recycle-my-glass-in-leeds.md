Glass isn’t currently collected from our homes in Leeds. However, there are more than 700 glass banks across Leeds, at close to 400 locations.

You can find your nearest glass bank [here](https://glass.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/#/). 

The Leeds Bins app on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1013036432?pt=2305324&ct=zerowasteleeds-glass-campaign&mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imactivate.bins&referrer=utm_source%3Dzerowasteleeds) also lets you know where your nearest glass bins are.

There are also glass recycling bins at each of the [Council’s Household Waste and Recycling Sites](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites). There is currently an online booking system in place to visit the Sites - more information and the booking form is [here](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites).

Last year we recycled over 12,000 tonnes of glass at recycling banks in Leeds - a 37% increase on the previous twelve months!  But it's estimated that around 13,000 tonnes ends up in black bins each year. That's the equivalent of 3 wine bottles in each household's black bin every fortnight.

The environmental impacts of not recycling glass are significant - and with the glass industry not currently getting as much glass from the hospitality industry, it's more important than ever that we recycle the glass we use at home - so that it can be turned into new products.

The glass you recycle in Leeds gets taken to a facility run by URM in South Yorkshire - where it is processed into "cullet" - to make new glass products. BBC Look North recently followed the journey of glass recycled in Leeds to the recycling plant. You can watch that [here](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/tips/what-happens-next-to-the-glass-i-recycle-in-leeds/) - including an interview with Gill from Zero Waste Leeds.

You can find out lots more about the difference it makes when we all recycle our glass in [a new campaign](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/projects/leeds-glass-recycling/) we've just launched - focusing on the environmental impacts of recycling your glass.
