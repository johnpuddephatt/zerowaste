Each June there is a massive movement of student tenants from the Hyde Park, Headingley and Woodhouse communities. In the rush to move, lots of things get thrown away that could be put to good use by others.

The End of Term Big Clear Out project want to help students from across these communities to donate their unwanted items for the benefit of local people, rather than throwing them away.

The project was set up last summer and is a collaboration between local Councillors, University of Leeds, Leeds Beckett University and local community organisations. Volunteers through the project help to collect student's unwanted belongings direct from their homes and pass these on to local people and charities most in need.

Last year they were able to collect around 16 tonnes of unwanted items, worth an equivalent of £83,626!

Volunteers are essential in making this project a success. This includes distributing leaflets and donation bags to student's homes and helping to round up donations ready for collection.

There are several tasks and dates they need volunteer help for:

* Flyer and Donation Bag Drop: 5th and 8th June. A map, PPE and canvas shoulder bags will be provided.
* Donation collections: 14th, 21st and 28th June (Mondays). Volunteers will meet at one of the three community meeting points at 12 noon to receive a briefing. After the briefing volunteers will help to round up donations so these can be easily accessed by the universities vans.

If you are able to help please complete **[their form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=qO3qvR3IzkWGPlIypTW3yx39Z9tJKexNs_Zg_1Z5dnBUMzRFTUs3QkFUU1Y3Q1BHSDZYWDdYQkVXWS4u)** including your name, mobile number, and the date or dates you are willing to help and they will be in touch with details.
