Leeds is fortunate to be home to so many charities and social enterprises that help us to live a less wasteful life. Many of these organisations run regular events and workshops. Why not check them out and show your support.

## Repair

### Leeds Repair Cafe

Leeds Repair Cafe run monthly-ish events in various venues. Together with skilled volunteers and their tools, people can start making their repairs. The cafe usually has volunteers on hand who are expert fixers of clothes, jewellery, electricals and computers. If you want to check before you bring something along, post it on the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/252645815067316/) or event page. If you have nothing to repair, you can enjoy a drink or snack, or you can lend a hand with someone else’s repair job. You can also get inspired at the reading table – by leafing through books on repairs and DIY.

*Various locations \[NB: They are looking for a permanent venue, so please get in touch with them if you can think of anywhere suitable near central Leeds].*
