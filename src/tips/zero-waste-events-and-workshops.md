Leeds is fortunate to be home to so many charities and social enterprises that help us to live a less wasteful life. Many of these organisations run regular events and workshops. Why not check them out and show your support.

## Reuse, upcycling, and repair

### **Seagulls** 

Seagulls is a social enterprise based in the heart of Leeds. They aim to promote the reuse and repurposing of unwanted materials and sustainable living solutions whilst providing volunteering, training and job opportunities for marginalised people. Seagulls offer a range of [workshops and courses](https://seagullsreuse.org.uk/lifehouse/) from mosaic to decorating, silversmithing to upcycling.

### Leeds Wood Recycling CIC 

Leeds Wood Recycling is a social enterprise that is passionate about the environment, recycling, social change and investing in the people of the community. They work to divert wood from landfill, collecting timber from commercial and domestic businesses and construction sites. The collected wood waste is used to offer opportunities; teaching people how to manufacture products, gifts, furniture and garden/ exterior products to sell in the shop or as private commissions. They also run a reclaimed timber shop open to the public, selling our rescued timber at affordable prices.
