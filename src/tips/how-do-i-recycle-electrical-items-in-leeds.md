It’s important not to put **electrical items** that are no longer working in your black bin or in your green bin. 

They can present a fire hazard in the bin wagon - and throwing them away is also a waste of precious natural resources. Many small electrical items contain materials that - if they're collected for recycling - can be recovered and used again.\

So what can you do? [](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/electricals)[There's more information on the Council website](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/electricals) - including this map which shows where there are banks across Leeds for dropping off electrical items for recycling.

Longer term, there are plans in place to make it easier for you to return small electrical items to the retailer you bought them from. But for now you can either find a small electrical bank on the map, or [book to visit a Household Waste Site](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites).  

If you have a **large electrical item**, such as a TV or washing machine, and it's still in good condition and in working order, then please think about donating it to a charity shop. There's [a list of some of the local charities that take items](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/get-rid-of-unwanted-items) (and which offer a limited collection service) on the Council website.   

If you're buying a new item like a washing machine, it's worth finding out whether the retailer will take away your old item, either for a fee or free of charge.

Large electrical items can also be recycled at [Household Waste Sites](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites) - which are currently operating with [a booking system](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites) in place.  

If you're unable to get to a Household Waste Site, the Council offers a collection service for bulky items, which costs £20 per collection.  More information on this service is available [on their website](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/book-an-unwanted-items-collection).
