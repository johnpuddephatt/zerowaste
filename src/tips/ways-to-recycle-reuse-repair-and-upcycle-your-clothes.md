Did you know that 4,000 tonnes of clothing and textiles end up in Leeds' black bins every year? There are so many better options that are much kinder for our planet and your pocket!

We've created [a map which shows all the charity shops and textile banks in Leeds](https://map.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/#/) - so you know where to go to donate (and buy second hand).

Here are some things to consider when thinking about your wardrobe and ways to avoid waste and be more sustainable.

- One of the best things you can do is to buy fewer and better quality clothes that last more than just a few seasons. Fast fashion means high volumes, low prices, cheap imitations, speedy production which equates to poorly made clothes, often questionable labour, waste and pollution.
- Wash your clothes less and use cool water to save energy and lengthen the life of the fabrics.
- Choose clothes made from natural fibres and limit synthetic materials which are more difficult to recycle and more complex to degrade
- Visit a sewing shop to get clothes mended or to refashion existing clothes. Even better learn to do it yourself by visiting a sewing workshop!
- Buy secondhand – there are so many options to do this in Leeds, including clothes exchanges, charity shops and pop-up swaps
- Support local makers – visit markets, fairs or even find a local designer.
- Try to avoid garments that use a combination of textiles, metals and plastics such as zips, studs, poppers, buttons, stones, furs, synthetic and natural fibres.
