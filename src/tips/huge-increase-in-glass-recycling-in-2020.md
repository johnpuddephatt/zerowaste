During 2020, the amount of glass that people in Leeds recycled at glass banks in the city increased by a massive 37%.

Between us, we recycled over 12,000 tonnes of bottles and jars in the 700 glass banks that are dotted around the city.

That’s the equivalent of around 130 bottles and jars recycled by each Leeds household.

## Why was there such a big increase in 2020?

The amount of glass recycled in Leeds had been pretty steady for the three years prior to 2020, at around 9,000 tonnes.  But there was a massive increase in 2020.  Why was that?

It’s likely that the biggest factor was, of course, COVID 19 and the restrictions that we all experienced for many months during 2020.

With pubs and restaurants closed for months, many of us were eating and drinking more at home.  

And it seems that a lot of us used some of that extra time we had on our hands to find our local glass bank and recycle all those extra bottles and jars.

The importance of supermarkets - particularly at times when other shops were closed, is reflected in the figures too - with around 50% of the glass recycled in Leeds being recycled at glass banks at supermarkets.

But banks across the city - in car parks, on street corners, or next to pubs and social clubs all saw big increases too - perhaps reflecting the fact that many of us spent much more time than before going on walks near where we live.

## How do we know all of this?

Each time a glass bank is collected, the glass it contains is weighed, and this information is shared on Data Mill North.  

To inform this campaign, which is funded by Friends of Glass, Ardagh Glass and Friends of Glass, we analysed data for glass recycling in Leeds over the period since 2016.  

It was when we spotted the big increase last summer that we came up with the idea for running a campaign to encourage people to keep recycling their glass as things return to some kind of normality post COVID 19.
