The use of toxic weedkillers like glyphosate is sadly rife in the UK. The problem is they don’t just kill weeds, they destroy everything around them including the insects we rely on to pollinate and give life. 

Crazy isn’t it. The fact is we get into habits, sometimes passed down within families, maybe from a time when we didn’t know any better. It’s so important that we break those habits and all do our bit to reverse the damage being done to our eco systems. Latest reports show that around one million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many within decades

Things you can do instead:

* Appreciate the weeds – many of them provide important food for pollinators, can be beautiful to look at, some are even edible, and really have just had terrible PR for too many years. Next time you see a dandelion, daisy, red clover, thistle, sticky weed, appreciate their value!
* If weeds are causing problems in certain parts of your garden then cover the soil with mulch. It will block the light and suppress the weeds. Make the mulch from your household and garden waste - cardboard, newspapers, shredded bark, organic matter from the kitchen too– a really good zero waste approach.
* Weeds growing in the gaps of patio and driveways is a really common issue. The best solution I’ve found is to weed by hand. If that isn’t an option try a homemade organic weedkiller. There are plenty of recipes online that usually include a mixture of vinegar, salt, and washing up liquid. Just be aware that these can also cause distress to wildlife so keep it to a minimum.

As with all these things, it’s so important to not only change your own habits but to share what you’re doing with your friends and families. Tell them why you’ve chosen not to use glyphosate in your outdoor space and love nature instead.
