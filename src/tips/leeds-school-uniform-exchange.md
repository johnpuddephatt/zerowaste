We’re building a movement to help Leeds become a Zero Waste City by 2030. As part of that we’re developing a school uniform re-use network to support and map uniform reuse schemes that are already happening across Leeds.

Leeds School Uniform Exchange is a project launched by Zero Waste Leeds, with funding from Leeds City Council and Leeds Community Foundation's Jimbo's Fund.

We have started to map all of the school uniform re-use schemes that we know about, but we need your help! This map is a work-in-progress, so if you spot any school uniform reuse schemes that we have missed, please let us know using the form below or follow this [link](https://forms.gle/TbbcxuSpPPgczCth8).

If there is not currently a uniform reuse scheme in place at your school, we are currently developing an 'Inspiration Guide' for how you could get started as a parent or teacher. Keep an eye out on our [Leeds School Uniform Reuse Exchange group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/603050533660854/permalink/605410550091519/?notif_id=1593425728610333&notif_t=group_description_change) on Facebook for updates. 

For good quality unbranded school uniform like plain shirts, trousers, skirts etc., most charities will also accept these. See our [Zero Waste Fashion map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?hl=en&mid=18ktKdUeew3oQpjOnezeTyLtt9pk1KK7w&ll=53.836763656561054%2C-1.5013154999999268&z=11) below. For uniform that is worn-out and not reusable, you can recycle it at a textile bank - find your nearest on the map below.
