We’re building a movement to help Leeds become a Zero Waste City by 2030. As part of that we’ve launched a new project to support the development of a network of uniform reuse schemes across Leeds.

We would like to say a massive thank you to Leeds City Council and [Leeds Community Foundation](https://leedscf.org.uk/)'s Jimbo's Fund for their support for this project.

To kick things off, we pulled together a [map of school uniform re-use schemes in Leeds.](https://leedsuniformexchange.org.uk/map/) If you know of any school uniform reuse schemes that we have missed, please let us know [here](https://leedsuniformexchange.org.uk/contact/).

If there is not currently a uniform reuse scheme in place at your school, we have developed some inspiration guides for [setting up a Facebook/WhatsApp group](https://issuu.com/zerowasteleeds/docs/how_to_guide_-_facebook_or_whatsapp__6_) or a [full redistribution scheme.](https://issuu.com/zerowasteleeds/docs/school_community_group_or_involved_parent)

Keep an eye out on the dedicated Leeds School Uniform Exchange [website](https://leedsuniformexchange.org.uk/) and [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/603050533660854/permalink/605410550091519/?notif_id=1593425728610333&notif_t=group_description_change) on for updates.

For good quality unbranded school uniform like plain shirts, trousers, skirts etc., most charities will also accept these. See our [Leeds Fashion map](https://map.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/#/) below. And for uniform that is worn-out and not reusable, you can recycle it at a textile bank - find your nearest on the map below.
