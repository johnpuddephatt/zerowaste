We’re building a movement to help Leeds become a Zero Waste City by 2030. As part of that we’re developing a school uniform re-use network to support and map uniform reuse schemes that are already happening across Leeds.

Leeds School Uniform Exchange is a project launched by Zero Waste Leeds, with funding from Leeds City Council and Leeds Community Foundation's Jimbo's Fund.

We have started to map the school uniform re-use schemes we know of but we need your help! This map is a work-in-progress, so if you spot any school uniform reuse schemes that we have missed, please let us know using the form below or follow this [link](https://forms.gle/TbbcxuSpPPgczCth8).

Wouldn't it be great if in 5 years time reusing school uniforms was a normal - and easy thing to do in Leeds?
