We are doing all we can to make it as easy as possible for people in Leeds to share good quality, free, second hand school uniform.

With support from funders including Leeds City Council and [Leeds Community Foundation](https://leedscf.org.uk/)'s Jimbo's Fund we have developed Leeds School Uniform Exchange - supporting people, community groups and schools across Leeds to set up online or pop-up school uniform exchanges.

We're delighted to say that as we approach the first birthday of Leeds School Uniform Exchange, there are close to 100 exchanges active in our city - a mix of Facebook groups organised by parents, lost property redistribution schemes run by schools, and pop up exchanges run by local community groups.

To find out if there's an exchange for your school, have a look at [our Leeds School Uniform Exchange website](https://leedsuniformexchange.org.uk/) - where you'll find [a searchable map](https://leedsuniformexchange.org.uk/map/).  

As well as lots of [Facebook groups](https://leedsuniformexchange.org.uk/places/category/facebook-pages/) for specific schools, we've got a [Leeds School Uniform Exchange Facebook group](https://x.facebook.com/groups/603050533660854?bac=MTYyMDExNTMzMDo3OTU3MDcyMDEwNjE4NTI6Nzk1NzA3MjAxMDYxODUyLDAsMDoyMDpLdz09&multi_permalinks) - which has over 1500 members.  That's a great place for asking for, or offering, free, good quality school uniform - particularly if either there isn't an exchange for your school, or if you haven't been able to find what you need through your local exchange.

# Nothing at your school?  Can we help you to set something up?

We've found that the easiest way to encourage more sharing of school uniform is to set up a Facebook group for your school - and we've shared lots of top tips on how to do that [in our guide](https://issuu.com/zerowasteleeds/docs/how_to_guide_-_facebook_or_whatsapp__6_).

We've also written a guide for how to set up a project to collect and redistribute school uniform - you can read that [here](https://issuu.com/zerowasteleeds/docs/school_community_group_or_involved_parent).  

If you've got any questions, [please get in touch](<mailto: info@zerowasteleeds.org.uk>) and we'll do our best to help.
