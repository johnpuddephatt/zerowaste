Gill from Zero Waste Leeds recently featured twice on BBC Radio Five Live talking about practical ways to cut down on food waste as part of their Leeds City On A Mission series. 

The first clip also includes a trip to Kirkgate Market where Five Liveâ€™s Chris Warburton finds out how to cook a low carbon fry up, featuring chef [Anthony O'Shaughnessy](https://www.anthonyshock.com/anthonyoshaughnessy) and more. 

Five Live also followed the journey of the [Leeds Dads](https://leedsdads.org/) who were trying over the week to cut down on food waste at home. It was great to hear honest reflections on how hard it can be at times amidst busy lives - alongside the small changes that the dads who are part of the group are making. 

There are plenty of tips our dedicated [food waste page](www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/tag/food-waste).
