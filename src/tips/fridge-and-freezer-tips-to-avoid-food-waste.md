Of the 6.6 million tonnes of food we throw away, 70% of it ***could have been eaten*** - that’s 4.5 million tonnes of food we could save from the bin with a bit more thought and planning.

When it comes to avoiding food waste, the fridge and freezer are our friends. We have compiled a list of handy tips to help you make the most of them and prevent food from ending up in the bin. 

## FRIDGE TIPS

 Organisation is asbolutely key to reduce food waste. Here are three simple steps you can follow when it comes to organising your fridge: 

1.Rotate goods when new items come in, simply put the new stuff at the back and move the older stuff to the front

2.Create an "eat me first" box or shelf in your fridge. Move everything that needs eating first there, so that you visually see what needs using up

3.Make a habit of going through your fridge twice a week, making a note of food items that will go off soon





## Freezer tips

### According to Hubbub, families could save up to £250 a year by using their freezer more efficiently. So here are some of our best tips when it comes to our freezer:

### 1.Check the temperature- freezers must be kept at -18**°C or lower to maintain their quality**

### **2.If unsure, doublecheck: almost everything can be frozen safely without losing its quality or nutritional value so it's always worth checking. For example, did you know you can freeze cooked rice, milk and cheese?**

3. Make the most of it: your freezer can be used to store batch cooking, save leftovers or to save ingredients from spoling before you get a chance to use them
