Through Together For Sport, we want to making it easy for people to share sports kit - whether that’s football boots, running shoes or cricket bats.

We know how much good it can do us to get outdoors and get active.  But sometimes the cost of kit can be a barrier to getting involved.  That’s where Together For Sport - and the people of Leeds - can help.

From the **6th - 26th June** there will be donation points across Leeds for you to be able to donate sports kit and equipment knowing it will be distributed to the people that will benefit from it the most. 

If you have any donations of trainers, football boots, shin pads, hoodies and socks, in either adult or children's sizes, please drop them into the designated collection bins located in the reception area of the following leisure centres:

* Fearnville Leisure Centre - Oakwood Lane LS8 3LF. Opening Hours: Mon 8am-9pm, Tue - Thurs 9.15am-9pm, Fri 8am-9pm, Sat 8am-6pm and Sun 8am-5pm
