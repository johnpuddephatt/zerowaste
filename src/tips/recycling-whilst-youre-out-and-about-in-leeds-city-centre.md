Did you know that in the centre of Leeds we've got over 80 recycling bins - so that you can recycle empty plastic bottles, drinks cans and coffee cups whilst you're out and about?

The orange and yellow bins came to our streets as part of a project called [\#LeedsByExample](https://www.hubbub.org.uk/leeds-by-example) - led by environmental charity [Hubbub](https://www.hubbub.org.uk/), working alongside [Leeds City Council](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling).

We were a partner on the project too - and you may well have seen us out and about in the city centre, with our ReCycler bike, promoting on-the-go recycling.

It's now much easier than it was previously to recycle when you're out and about. And with cafes primarily offering takeaway service at the moment, you may well find yourself with a plastic bottle, drinks can or coffee cup to recycle. You won't have to look far for one of the #LeedsByExample bins - yellow for plastic and cans, orange for coffee cups. Our map lets you know where the bins are:

[Leeds City Council](https://twitter.com/Leeds_City_Ctr) and [Leeds BID](https://twitter.com/LeedsBID/status/1272479592771719168), are working very hard to keep the city centre as clean as possible during the COVID-19 epidemic - and the recycling bins - alongside all street furniture, are being cleaned on a regular basis. You can find out more about this [here](https://news.leeds.gov.uk/news/further-information-and-guidance-issued-ahead-of-shops-reopening-in-leeds-city-centre).

We'd like to thank you for recycling whilst you're out and about in Leeds city centre!
