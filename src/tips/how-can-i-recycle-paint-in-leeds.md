If you have paint that could be used by someone else, local social enterprise[ Seagulls Paint](https://seagullsreuse.org.uk/) can take it for resale.

You can drop off paint for reuse at Household Waste Sites across Leeds, which are [continuing to operate with a booking system](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling/recycling-sites). Reusable paint will then be collected by Seagulls, for resale from [their shop on Kirkstall Road](https://seagullsreuse.org.uk/contact/kirkstall-shop/). So don't forget to think of Seagulls next time you need some paint!

You can find out the latest on Seagulls' opening hours on [their social media](https://www.instagram.com/seagullspaint/?hl=en).

Here's a short film, premiered at 2019's Leeds International Film Festival, that tells their story.

Seagulls founders Cat and Kate were recently shortlisted for the BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour Powerlist - you can listen to the interview with Cat, and one of their volunteers Ash, [here](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds/posts/903532876871903).
