As we know, school uniform can be expensive, so we've come up with some top tips to help make your child's uniform last longer.

# **Keeping Shirts White**

White school shirts and polo T-shirts can start looking grey after repeat washes, even when doing a white wash. To brighten them up, add a couple of dashes of washing up liquid to your washing machine drum. Don't put too much in, a third of a cap full should be plenty. otherwise you'll have too many suds in your machine.

# **Prevent Fading**

To prevent dark jumpers, cardigans, skirts and trousers from fading, add a cup of distilled white vinegar to the wash. And for uniform with logos, make sure to wash them inside out so that the logo doesn't get caught and start fraying.

# **Removing Stains**

To remove ballpoint pen stains, use hairspray. Spray on the stain, wait 30 seconds for it to do its magic then wipe off with a damp cloth. For permanent marker, use some hand sanitizer, work it into the stain, rinse then wash as normal. Grass stains will come out with a rub of a white vinegar and baking soda mixed into a paste before going in the washing machine. 

For school paint stains, mix a good squirt of washing up liquid with water and splash it onto the paint stains. Stain removal works best when the paint is wet. Gently rub the stain with a laundry brush, or the bottom of the washing powder scoop if it has the little bobbles on it. Put your hand inside the fabric and rub the stained fabric onto your hand. This seems to work well to really rub at the stain. You will end up with what looks like an even bigger mess but don't panic. Rinse the t-shirt out with cool water, then continue rubbing for three or four minutes by which time the paint should have gone and the uniform is now ready for the wash.

Some stains respond better to washing at low temperatures - water based stains like coffee, tea, egg, milk, deodorant for example. Washing these at high temperatures effectively 'cooks' them in.

# **Upcycling Trousers**

If trousers are getting too short, are frayed at the bottom or are wearing thin on the knees, cut them into shorts ready for the summer. If your sewing skills aren't up to scratch to hem, simply get some iron on hemming tape.

# **Removing Bobbles**

If uniform has gone bobbly, purchase a fabric shaver, there are plenty to choose from online and they’re very affordable, Jersey material is particularly prone to bobbling and is often used in stretchy material used in jumpers, cardigans, trousers, skirts and pinafores. I regularly use mine and it makes the uniform look as good as new.

# **Keeping shoes shiny**

If you haven't got any shoe polish in, simply use a bit of vegetable oil. Make sure to clean the shoes first then smear with a bit of oil, leave a couple of minutes before wiping off any excess. It won't necessarily make them shine as the oil soaks into the leather but it will give the shoes a protective barrier. For scuffed shoes, simply colour in the scuff marks with a black marker pen. For patent shoes, paint the fronts with clear nail varnish to provide an invisible protective layer to help reduce scuffs.
