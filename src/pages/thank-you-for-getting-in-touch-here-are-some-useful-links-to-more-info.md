## Thank you for getting in touch with Zero Waste Leeds.

We love the fact that so many people get in touch with us, but as we get lots of questions and enquiries it often takes us a few days to respond - as much of our work is currently unfunded. 

In the meantime here are some answers to some of the things people contact us about most regularly.
