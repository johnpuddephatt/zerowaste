## Thank you for getting in touch with Zero Waste Leeds.

We love the fact that so many people get in touch with us, but as we get lots of questions and enquiries and much of our social media work is currently unfunded we can't always respond. 

If your question is about Council services such as bins, waste or recycling, please visit [their dedicated website](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/bins-and-recycling) or contact [Leeds Recycles Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/LeedsRecycles). 

Additionally, here are some answers to some of the things people contact us about most regularly.
