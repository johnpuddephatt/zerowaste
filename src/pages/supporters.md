We’re building a movement to help make Leeds a zero waste city by 2030.  We do this by starting conversations, listening to and sharing people’s ideas, and testing new solutions.

We inhabit the space between local government, business, education, communities and individuals who want to work with us to create a more sustainable way of life.  Our aim is to inspire more people to waste less and reuse and recycle more.

Everything we do is collaborative and in partnership with others.

## Our impact

In 2020 so far we've collaborated with around 60 local and national organisations and groups to help Leeds become a zero waste by 2030. 

In the last six months, we've appeared on [TV, radio and in print ](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/media-coverage/)14 times sharing positive news stories about ways we can waste less, reuse and recycle more in our city.

The impact of the first 10 weeks of our most recent project, [Leeds School Uniform Exchange](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/reflecting-on-two-months-of-leeds-school-uniform-exchange/) can be seen below. 

We're also now leading on phase 3 of [\#LeedsbyExample on-the-go recycling](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/leedsbyexample-on-the-go-recycling/) project, the earlier phases of which saw recycling rates in the city increase by a third.

All our projects and campaigns are about inspiring people to live and work more sustainably, and connecting people to ways they can do that in Leeds.
