We’re looking for a hands-on social media volunteer to work with us to increase our online presence on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and help to build a growing network of people who want to make positive changes in our city. 

###### Who are we?

Zero Waste Leeds is part of Social Business Brokers CIC, a social enterprise with a small team that has been working for over ten years on creative, collaborative approaches to tackling social and environmental issues in Leeds.  

Our goal is to build a mass movement to make Leeds a zero waste city by 2030. We do this by actively promoting practical and easy ways for people to [](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/) live a more waste free life, and sharing all the great things already happening across the city.  

We also run behaviour change campaigns and projects.  Current ones include [\#LeedsFashionFutures](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/leeds-fashion-futures/), [Leeds School Uniform Exchange](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/leeds-school-uniform-exchange/) and [\#LeedsbyExample on-the-go recycling](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/leedsbyexample-on-the-go-recycling/).  

We have a growing community of over 12,000 followers on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zerowasteleeds/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZeroWasteLeeds). You can read more about us here on our [website](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/). 



#### Who are we looking for?

We’d love to work with someone who already has an interest in the environment and sustainable living, as well as an awareness of social issues in our city.  

Other desirable skills/experience would include: 

• Experience of running or helping out on social media campaigns - formally or informally. 

• Good communication skills

• Works well in a team

• Mobile film/editing experience/photography  

#### What would you be doing?

Every day is different but we mainly need support to:

* Keep our Instagram and Facebook pages active and interesting by working with us to come up with new content for our core zero waste work and current projects.  
* Respond to questions/queries from our followers across all platforms
* Come up with new ideas to help us grow our social media presence and help raise awareness of the work we do and all the great things happening in our city. 
* Share inspiring stories in creative ways from communities across the city. 
* Keep an eye on social media trends, undertaking some regular analytics 

#### Working as part of a team

You’d be joining a small friendly team who are committed to making a positive difference.  The hours you volunteer with us are flexible and despite working remotely right now, we regularly check-in with each other online. 

What this volunteering experience could offer you: 

• An ability to make a difference in an area of interest

• Gain experience of working for a social enterprise on a variety of interesting campaigns. 

• Insight into the running of a small organisation including funding bids, communications approaches. 



We believe this is a great opportunity to make a big difference within a small organisation.
