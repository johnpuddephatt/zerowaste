We are currently recruiting for a full-time, paid graduate internship role at [Social Business Brokers CIC](http://www.socialbusinessbrokers.co.uk/), the social enterprise that runs Zero Waste Leeds.

This is a full-time role, for twelve months, to start ASAP.  It will be an excellent opportunity for a recent graduate to gain valuable experience working as part of a small team taking an innovative approach to tackling  social issues in Leeds.

We are on the look-out for a recent graduate who shares our passion for changing our city and the world.  Someone who is ready to get stuck in to practical projects that make our city a better place.

The primary focus of the role will be to help us to build a movement to help Leeds to become a zero waste city by 2030 - working as part of our Zero Waste Leeds team.

The successful candidate will work with us to build our highly engaged, local online community - which currently numbers over 15,000 people across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.  

They will also join our small team in delivering a number of innovative waste reduction campaigns, on themes including glass recycling and school uniform reuse.  

They will also spend time working on our other main project - Empty Homes Doctor.  They will support our Empty Homes Doctors to grow our online presence - so that we can continue to find owners of empty homes - and help them bring their home back into use.
