We're looking to recruit a Communications and Marketing Co-ordinator to join our small team - to help us to build a grassroots zero waste movement in Leeds.  

Since starting up with a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds/) and not much else in 2018, we've delivered a number of successful projects in Leeds that have engaged a wide range of people in practical ways to waste less in their daily lives.

With over 15,000 social media followers, an established local media presence, and a wide network of local and national stakeholders, we feel that now is the time to invest more in how we communicate as effectively as we can with people - so we can continue to have more [impact](https://issuu.com/zerowasteleeds/docs/2020_impact_report__6_).

We are looking to recruit a Communications and Marketing Co-ordinator to join our team.  It's a 25 hour role, with an initial 12 month contract - with those hours worked flexibly, including, of course, home-working where appropriate and most effective.

We set up Zero Waste Leeds as our social enterprise wanted to get involved in a local, practical, community-led response to the climate emergency.  How we communicate with people, how we tell stories, how we share a vision of a better future, and how we encourage people to get involved are all key - both to our continued success, and, we believe, a sustainable future for the city and world we live in.

If you're a communications professional with a flair for engaging broad audiences - often on the tightest of budgets - then we'd love you to apply.  You can find more about the role [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1efA0OkOL08Wy1HORWwbtVtmaUZrZoD1W/view?usp=sharing).

The closing date for applications is 9am on Friday 21st May - and we plan to hold interviews online on the 26th and 27th of May.
