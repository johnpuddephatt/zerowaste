W﻿e're launching the Leeds Winter Coat Appeal again this year. Starting in October we aim to collect 2000 coats that we'll sort and redistribute to those that need them most in the city.

Why are we launching this appeal?\

Last year we ran a small but successful winter coat donation and distribution campaign giving out 500 good quality, second hand coats for children - for free.  This year has seen demand go through the roof and we are being contacted regularly by schools worried that their children won't have a warm winter coat this winter. 

Winter can be a difficult time of year for everyone, with increased fuel demands and more time spent inside. So, this years Winter Coat Appeal is going to be bigger than last year. We will also collect coats for all ages.

We aim to collect and distribute 2000 coats this winter and need your help.
By collecting donations of good quality second-hand coats (hats, scarves and gloves) and redistributing them to people who need them, we will help more people to stay wrapped up this winter.

Donating coats will also help to reduce clothing waste. Too many items of clothing go unworn and unloved. Most of these items of clothing could be rehomed and worn many more times by others.  We aim to encourage people to share the coats they no longer use so that others can use them - turning what would otherwise be clothing waste into a resource. It makes sense and is good for the environment.

**How can you get involved?** \
The appeal will launch on October 10th and it will run until November 14th. During that period, you will be able to donate your unwanted coats (and gloves, hats and scarfs) at our donation points, of which there are 5 located across the city:
