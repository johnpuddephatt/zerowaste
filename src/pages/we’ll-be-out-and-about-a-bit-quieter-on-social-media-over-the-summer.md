During July and August, you might notice that we’ll be a bit quieter than usual on our Zero Waste Leeds [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zerowasteleeds/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZeroWasteLeeds) accounts.

We love the community that has built up around Zero Waste Leeds since we set it up, with nothing more than a Facebook page, in 2018.

We’ve built up a really-engaged, local community of over 25,000 followers across our social media, exploring ways that we can all waste less in our everyday lives.



We’ve shared thousands of posts over that time, with loads of top tips on things like clothing, food waste and recycling.  And we’ve also run campaigns on all sorts of themes - including how to cut down on waste whilst we were all at home during lockdown, alongside campaigns on topics such as glass recycling & sustainable fashion.

We’ve also done all we can to share our platform with the individuals, community groups, social enterprises and local businesses that are doing great work in our city - helping us to move towards a more circular economy.  

But, with our costs rising and income falling, our social enterprise is having to reflect on how we keep doing what we do.

And the truth is that a lot of the community engagement that Zero Waste Leeds has done over the last four years - much of it on social media - has been unfunded. Our social enterprise has funded it through our reserves - because we think it’s importance work in itself, particularly in the context of a climate emergency. 

Our place-based work, which makes local connections and which makes the circular economy meaningful to people’s daily lives, is more vital than ever.  But we can’t fund it ourselves forever.  And we think it is important to make the point that if we want to build a different kind of economy, if we want to live in different ways, then new approaches such as ours require support.  It’s not realistic to create change with no budget. 

However, we’re reaching a stage where we can’t do that any more.  Creating engaging social media posts takes time and money.  And responding to people’s queries on anything and everything to do with waste reduction, is time-consuming.  

We LOVE that people contact us with just about every question you could ever imagine about recycling, reuse, repair and more!  But we are finding it hard to fund that work.

So over July and August we’re going to take a bit of a step back on social media.  

We will still be sharing lots of information about our current campaigns, [Leeds School Uniform Exchange](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/projects/school-uniform-exchange/) and [Together For Sport](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/projects/together-for-sport/) - as both of those projects will be out and about across Leeds during the summer holidays.

And we’ll keep sharing our platform - sharing posts from local organisations that are doing great work - to help them to reach more people.

But we’ll be quieter in other ways - we won’t be sharing posts on how to waste less, or how to recycle better.  And unfortunately we won’t be able to respond to the many questions we get each week. 

We’ll take this time to think about the bigger picture of what we do and how we can continue to support it. We’d love to hear your thoughts and ideas on this.

It’ll also help us to make sure that we have as big an impact as possible over the summer, with Leeds School Uniform Exchange and Together For Sport.

So we’re hopeful this is a pause, not a full stop.  And we’ll keep you updated - we’ll share thoughts on where we go next in September, if not before.

And finally, thank you to all of you who are part of Zero Waste Leeds - sharing your enthusiasm, ideas and, of course, your stuff.  We think we’ve done some great things together and we are hopeful that we can continue to do that.
