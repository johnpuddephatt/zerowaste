We've achieved an enormous amount in the couple of months that we've been working on encouraging more school uniform reuse in Leeds!



There's been a fantastic response from people across Leeds.  Community groups have come forward to run local uniform exchanges, and parents from across the city have set up Facebook groups to make it easier for people to swap uniforms at their schools.

And our Leeds School Uniform Exchange Facebook group is a hive of activity - with over 1000 members offering and requesting school uniform all across our city.

Our map lists all the uniform reuse schemes that we know about so far.

But we want to do so much more.

We know full well that we've only just begun, and that there's still loads to do.  

We've been thinking about how to build on what we've done so far, so that second hand school uniform  truly becomes first choice in Leeds.

And why stop in Leeds?  We think our model - encouraging whoever's best placed in local communities - schools, parents, or community groups - to set up a reuse scheme near them - has potential to work just about anywhere.

Can you help us to create a platform for sharing?

One of the things we've been working on behind the scenes is a database for the project.

A list of schools.  Their uniform requirements.  Their contact details.  Their social media accounts.  Plus information about any schemes - either run by the school, or by parents, or by a local community group -
