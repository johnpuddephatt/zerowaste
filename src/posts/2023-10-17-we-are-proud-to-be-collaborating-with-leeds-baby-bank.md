This year, the Leeds Winter Coat Appeal will be working with Leeds Baby Bank.

It made perfect sense to collaborate with Leeds Baby Bank as it is their mission to ensure no child goes without.  They support families in Leeds, with children aged 0-5 years, who are experiencing poverty by providing them with all the essentials and equipment they need for their babies and young children.  Families are referred to Leeds Baby Bank by professional referral partners, including midwives, health visitors and social workers. This ensures they're helping families who are in the most need.

The Leeds Winter Coat Appeal will be collecting donations of baby coats, snow suits, waterproofs, sleeping bags, pram foot muffs, hats, scarves and gloves and will pass them on to the Leeds Baby Bank.
