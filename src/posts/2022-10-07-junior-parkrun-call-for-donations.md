No one should ever feel excluded from running because they don't have the right kit or equipment. That’s why [Together For Sport](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/projects/together-for-sport/) – our project to help redistribute great quality second hand sports kit around the city so everyone can take part - is teaming up with the amazing [Junior Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/).

\
On Sunday 16th October we’re calling for donations of good quality trainers and non event-specific running tops, shorts and leggings in children’s and young people’s sizes. 

There will be a collection points at the following 6 Junior Park Run events across the city - Bramley, Roundhay, Cross Flatts, Horsforth and Bodington.

Please make sure that any donations are washed, clean and bagged before donating.  We’d also love you to tell all your friends about it so please share our posts on [Facebook](www.facebook.com/ZeroWasteLeeds), [Twitter](www.twitter.com/ZeroWasteLeeds) and [Instagram](www.Instagram.com/ZeroWasteLeeds).
