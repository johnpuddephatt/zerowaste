As part of our [\#LeedsFashionFutures](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/projects/leeds-fashion-futures/) project, we recently spoke with [Sunny Bank Mills](https://www.sunnybankmills.co.uk/) archivist Rachel Moaby, to explore the rich history of the Mill, and to learn about it's exciting reinvention over recent years.

You can catch up with the conversation on our YouTube channel:

[Sunny Bank Mills traces its roots back to 1829](https://www.sunnybankmills.co.uk/our-story/history/), when a group of local clothiers invested together to purchase land and build a woollen scribbling and fulling mill, known as The Farsley Club Mill.

Containing over 60,000 lengths of cloth, 8000 fabric designs, 5000 dye cards, guard books and artefacts associated with nearly 200 years of cloth production, [their archive](https://www.sunnybankmills.co.uk/heritage/) is a source of inspiration to history lovers, artists and anyone fascinated by heritage and textiles.

The beautiful mill buildings [are being regenerated](https://www.sunnybankmills.co.uk/) by the sixth generationÂ of the family owners, with current tenants including an art gallery and a wide range of businesses.  

Our conversation with Rachel shone a light on the rich history of Sunny Bank Mills - and was a starting point for a broader conversation about how important textile production has been in the growth of Leeds and West Yorkshire over the years.
