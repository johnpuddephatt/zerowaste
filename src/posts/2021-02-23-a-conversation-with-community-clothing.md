As part of our [\#LeedsFashionFutures](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/projects/leeds-fashion-futures/) project, we recently spoke with Jenny Whisker from [Community Clothing](https://communityclothing.co.uk/) - to understand more about how their innovative social enterprise is helping to provide more good jobs to skilled workers at clothing manufacturers across the UK.

Community Clothing is a social enterprise set up by [Patrick Grant](https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/patrick-grant) - who many of you may know through The Great British Sewing Bee.

You can catch up with the conversation with Jenny on our YouTube channel:

Community Clothing work with clothing manufacturers across the UK - and you can find out more about their innovative business model here.

One of the main innovations is around off-peak production.  Due to the seasonality of much of the fashion industry, there can be big peaks and troughs in work at clothing factories - which can obviously impact on their ability to provide good, stable jobs.

This is where Community Clothing comes in - as they work with clothing manufacturers across the UK to produce clothing for Community Clothing during those quieter times.  

They also have a focus on what you might call utility clothing - everyday essentials - rather than ever-changing fashion.  This allows them to iterate current designs - rather than invest in the expensive process of designing completely new items.  This cuts out another key cost - thus leaving more margin to pay the people who make our clothes decent wages.

Patrick Grant talks more about the Community Clothing business model - and the reasons it's needed - in this Tedx Talk

We think it's an inspiring business model - providing one way to perhaps buy more of your clothes from a supplier that's investing in local factories, providing good employment for highly-skilled workers.

Through our #LeedsFashionFutures project, a collaboration with [the RSA](https://www.thersa.org/) and their[ Regenerative Futures ](https://www.thersa.org/regenerative-futures)project, we are exploring how to create a different kind of future for clothing and fashion - a future which has sustainability at its heart.
