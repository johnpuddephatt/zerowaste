Over the next few months we’ll be sharing everything we know about glass recycling with you!  It’s part of a campaign we’re running to get even more people recycling glass in our city and understanding why it’s important.  

In fact you’re already doing a smashing job - last year the people of Leeds recycled 37% more glass than the year before! That’s over 12000 tonnes of bottles and jars, the equivalent of around 130 for each Leeds household.  Nice One Leeds! 

It’s a great place to start but wouldn’t it be great if we could build on that by recycling even more glass in the 700 glass banks dotted around our city. 

To help make it easier, we’ve developed a glass bank map so you can find the closest bank to you, we’ll also be sharing some practical tips and info like - did you know that you don’t have to colour sort your glass anymore, just throw it all in or that you can leave bottle tops on?  

We’ll be sharing all the reasons why using recycled glass to make new glass is much better for the environment and telling the story of the Yorkshire glass industry - a bottle you recycle in a bank here in Leeds could be back on the shelf in your local shop in just a few weeks without ever having left Yorkshire! 

Keep an eye out on our social media channels - Instagram, Facebook and Twitter - for competitions, quizzes and plenty more!
