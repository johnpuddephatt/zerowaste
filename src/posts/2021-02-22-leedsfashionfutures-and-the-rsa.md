To launch our [Leeds Fashion Futures](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/projects/leeds-fashion-futures/) Week, [we hosted a Facebook Live conversation](https://fb.watch/3PD1raWEFq/) with Josie Warden and Nat Ortiz from [The RSA](https://www.thersa.org/). 

The RSA have worked closely with us to develop the #LeedsFashionFutures project - and also provided funding for the project.

The conversation, hosted by Peg Alexander, explored how the project fits with a bigger project that The RSA have been running - called [Regenerative Futures](https://www.thersa.org/regenerative-futures) - which is exploring a future where humans thrive as part of the Earth’s ecology.

The RSA were keen to work with us in order to explore what a "place-based" approach to working on issues around clothing, fashion and the circular economy might look like.

They were interested in Leeds in part because of our previous [Zero Waste Fashion](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/leeds-fashion-futures/) work, but also because of Leeds' rich clothing and textile heritage.  

How can we explore and reflect upon that history - to help us to imagine what the future could look like - in relation to clothing and fashion?

Throughout our Leeds Fashion Futures Week we'll be exploring in more detail some of the key themes that have emerged through the project - specifically around heritage and tradition, skills & resources, and valuing our clothes.  

Some of the events we have lined up this week include:

[A talk about Sir Montague Burton, one of the key figures in the history of clothing in Leeds](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/who-was-sir-montague-burton/)

We'll also be sharing lots of stories & short videos, alongside plenty of top tips on the practical things we can do to make more sustainable clothing choices.

And we'll be launching a Leeds Textile Trail - helping to tell some of the great stories in Leeds rich clothing and textile past.
