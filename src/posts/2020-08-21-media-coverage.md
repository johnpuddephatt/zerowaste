Our work is all about building a movement to become a zero waste city by 2030. To do this requires reaching out beyond 'the converted', so getting media coverage is always a huge bonus!

We have featured a lot recently for our work on recycling, waste reduction, and school uniform reuse, including several appearances on BBC Look North, BBC Radio Leeds, Radio Aire and the Yorkshire Evening Post.

If you are interested in running a story about any of our work, please do [get in touch](mailto:info@zerowasteleeds.org.uk)!
