Throughout this year we've been exploring how we can work together as a city to reduce the negative environmental impacts of our clothing choices. 

In April this year we hosted an online [Zero Waste Fashion Week](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/zero-waste-fashion-week-2020/), and we have also developed a [Zero Waste Fashion website](https://zerowastefashion.fashion.blog/) with tips on where to recycle, reuse, repair and upcycle clothing and textiles in Leeds, including a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?hl=en&mid=18ktKdUeew3oQpjOnezeTyLtt9pk1KK7w&ll=53.83676365656107%2C-1.5013154999999188&z=11) of all the textile banks, charity shops, repair shops, sewing classes and clothes exchanges in Leeds.

You can watch a series of interviews with local designers who are exploring how to be more sustainable [on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msp47VGdgyw&list=PLcImqkHEpk0pY2cBDQoVIoptpDNTNN0-B).

In October we're launching an exciting new project, working alongside [The RSA](https://www.thersa.org/projects/make-fashion-circular) to explore what we can do as a city to minimise the negative impacts of our clothing choices.  We'll be exploring a range of themes, including what influences our choices around clothing, how we buy our clothes, how we look after them, and how we dispose of them.
