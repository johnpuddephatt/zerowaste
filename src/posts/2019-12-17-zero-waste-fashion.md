Many of us want to make more sustainable clothing choices but don’t know where to start. We’ve launched [Leeds Fashion Futures](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/projects/leeds-fashion-futures/) to explore how as a city we can do that.

This has been such an exciting project to work on with the [RSA](https://www.thersa.org/). Our three themes of Heritage, Valuing Your clothes and Skills & Resources have given us a real insight into what fashion means to people across Leeds.

As part of this project we've created [Leeds Fashion Map](https://map.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/), which includes zero waste fashion options including charity shops, textile banks, alterations and repairs, clothes exchanges, sewing workshops and sustainable fashion designers. We’re also adding local haberdashers and sewing machine sales, maintenance and repair shops.

We've also launched [The Leeds Textile Trail](https://trail.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/) - a journey through some of the people, places and events that make Leeds stand out in the world of clothing and textiles.
