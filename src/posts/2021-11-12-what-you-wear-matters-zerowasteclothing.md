During COP26, we launched #ZeroWasteClothing to explore the climate impacts of clothing and what can we do to help slow down fast fashion.   This includes using our collective voices to influence change where it matters.  

Over the two weeks we heard from local people through a series of lunchtime live chats. 

We spoke to students from Leeds University Fashion Soc, social media fashion influencers, a Leeds-based academic who spent 15 years working in retail for major international brands and now focuses on sustainability within the fashion industry, people who work in the city's thriving secondhand clothing scene and a TV/radio presenter who chooses to wear secondhand clothing on air and off. 

Here is a summary of highlights from the campaign.

## How we can help slow down fast fashion

We were delighted to speak to Dr Mark Sumner who is a leading academic in the field of sustainable fashion. He recently published an essay for the UK Government's All Party Parliamentary Climate Change Group which gives a clear insight into the climate impacts of the various parts of the multi-faceted fashion industry, and areas for improvement. 

This pie-chart summarises where clothing-related climate emissions come from. We were surprised to see that how we care for our clothes - washing, drying and ironing - accounts for 20% of the industry's emissions.  Given the fashion industry is responsible for around 8-10% of global emissions, that is significant.

Our campaign focused on 4 main calls to action 

* Take better care of your clothes
* Buy better
* Wear clothes for longer 
* Use your voice and influence.

## Take better care of your clothes

This was high on our list because making just a few small changes to how we care for our clothes can make a big difference to their overall environmental impact. 

This means washing clothes less and at lower temperatures, always checking garment labels and choosing to air dry your clothes.

**[Read our blogpost](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/tips/how-to-care-for-your-clothes-better/)** for more tips on how to care for your clothes better.  Gill shared her love of the washing line here!

## BUY BETTER AND CHOOSE SECOND HAND

Next big impact action we can take is to to Buy Better and by that we don't mean buying more expensive clothes!  

We share our [**4 tips for buying better in our blogpost here and ways you can do that easily in Leeds**.](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/tips/clothes-top-5-tips-for-buying-better/)  They are: 

1. Do a wardrobe audit before buying any more new clothes. 
2. Swap or donate clothes that you no longer wear. 
3. Do the 'will I wear it 30 times test?'
4. Buy secondhand/vintage
5. Check the brand. 

## Zero Waste Clothing Map

To make it even easier to make sustainable fashion choices in Leeds we updated our  **[\#ZeroWasteClothing map](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/projects/zero-waste-clothing/)** adding new categories like vintage shops, clothes exchanges, dress agencies and a list of sustainable fashion designers.

We also had the opportunity to discuss the importance of choosing second hand over buying new through Facebook and Instagram Lives.

On Friday the 5th we hosted June from [The Leeds Jewish Welfare Board](https://ljwb.co.uk/) shop and Lauren from [Leeds Community Clothes Exchange](https://leedscommunityclothesexchange.com/) to discuss the wonderful world of pre-loved shopping and the many options available to the people of Leeds.

We also hosted our very first Instagram Live to explore how we can switch to more sustainable alternatives and refuse to buy new with [Leeds Fashion Society](https://www.instagram.com/leedsunifashion/) from the University of Leeds. We met content creator and fashion advocate Gaia Rattazzi, fashion design student and sustainability architect Aerielle Rojas and sustainability and fashion enthusiast Mano Mori.

## WEAR CLOTHES FOR LONGER

If we all extended the use of our clothes by just nine months, therefore delaying the purchase of new clothes, we could reduce the carbon footprint by 8%!

That’s why wearing clothes for longer has been a key theme of our campaign. 

There are several ways to extend the life of our clothes and make sure we wear them for a longer period of time- from buying clothes we can wear more often to repairing the ones we already own.

[Read our top tips here. ](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/tips/slow-down-fashion-wear-your-clothes-longer/)

## USE YOUR VOICE AND INFLUENCE

Last but definitely not least, we've been sharing [ways that we can all use our voice to influence change. ](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/tips/slow-down-fast-fashion-use-your-influence/) That means asking the brands that you buy from what they're doing to reduce their impact on the planet, emailing your local MP or the government body influencing decisions around the environmental impact of the fashion industry.  It's so important to talk to your friends and colleagues about any changes you're making and why too.  See our [full list of impactful actions here. ](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/tips/slow-down-fast-fashion-use-your-influence/)

We had the opportunity to discuss this in more detail with journalist and TV, Radio and Podcast presenter Peg Alexander during another Instagram Live.

We asked Peg about her pledge to stop buying new new clothes and how she uses her influence as a public eye figure to raise awareness on sustainable fashion.
