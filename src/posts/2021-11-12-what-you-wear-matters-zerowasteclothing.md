During COP26, we launched #ZeroWasteClothing to explore the climate impacts of clothing and what can we do as individuals to help slow down fast fashion.   This includes using our collective voices to influence change where it matters.  

Over the two-week campaign we recorded our conversations with people in Leeds to hear their views on what the impactful actions we can take to slow down fast fashion and what challenges stand in our way. 

We spoke to students from Leeds University Fashion Soc, social media fashion influencers, a Leeds-based academic who spent 15 years working in retail for major international brands and now focuses on sustainability within the fashion industry, and a TV/radio presenter who chooses to wear secondhand clothing on air and off. 

Here is a summary of highlights from the campaign.

## How we can help slow down fast fashion

We were delighted to speak to Dr Mark Sumner who is a leading academic in the field of sustainable fashion. He recently published an essay for the UK Government's All Party Parliamentary Climate Change Group which gives a clear insight into the climate impacts of the various parts of the multi-faceted fashion industry, and areas for improvement. 

This pie-chart summarises where clothing-related climate emissions come from. We were most surprised that how we care for our clothes - washing, drying and ironing - accounts for 20% of the industry's emissions.
