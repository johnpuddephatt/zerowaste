During COP26, we launched #ZeroWasteClothing to explore the climate impacts of clothing and what can we do to help slow down fast fashion.   This includes using our collective voices to influence change where it matters.  



Over the two weeks we heard from local people through a series of lunchtime live chats. 

We spoke to students from Leeds University Fashion Soc, social media fashion influencers, a Leeds-based academic who spent 15 years working in retail for major international brands and now focuses on sustainability within the fashion industry, people who work in the city's thriving secondhand clothing scene and a TV/radio presenter who chooses to wear secondhand clothing on air and off. 

Here is a summary of highlights from the campaign.

## How we can help slow down fast fashion

We were delighted to speak to Dr Mark Sumner who is a leading academic in the field of sustainable fashion. He recently published an essay for the UK Government's All Party Parliamentary Climate Change Group which gives a clear insight into the climate impacts of the various parts of the multi-faceted fashion industry, and areas for improvement. 

This pie-chart summarises where clothing-related climate emissions come from. We were surprised to see that how we care for our clothes - washing, drying and ironing - accounts for 20% of the industry's emissions.  Given the fashion industry is responsible for around 8-10% of global emissions, that is significant.

Our campaign focused on 4 main calls to action 

* Take better care of your clothes
* Buy better
* Wear clothes for longer 
* Use your voice and influence.

## Take better care of your clothes

This was high on our list because making a few small changes can really make such a big difference in reducin the environmental impact of clothing.  

This means practical tips on how to switch to more sustainable habits-washing less and at low temperatures, checking garment labels and choosing to air dry your clothes.
