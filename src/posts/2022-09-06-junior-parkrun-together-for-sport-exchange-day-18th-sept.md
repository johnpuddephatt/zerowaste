We know how much good it can do us to get outdoors and get active. But sometimes the cost of kit can be a barrier to getting involved.  In Leeds a quarter of children are now living in poverty - an increase of 9% in a year. 

No one should ever feel excluded from running for not having the right kit or equipment. That’s why we started #TogetherForSport, with the mission of helping those who need it to play the sport they love by accessing great quality second-hand sports kit.

On the 18th September, six junior parkrun events are calling for donations of good quality trainers and non event-specific running tops, shorts and leggings in children’s and young people’s sizes. They will use these donations to give to new members who might want to join but buying kit has previously been a barrier.

Please make sure that any donations are washed, clean and bagged before donating. 

There will be collection points at the following events, all on the 18th September, 9am-10am.
