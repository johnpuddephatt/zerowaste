Winter coats are expensive, many families have had a tough couple of years and that means there are children in Leeds who could go without a warm winter coat for school.

.....But not if we can help it! As part of the Leeds School Uniform Exchange we are launching the Children's Winter Coat Appeal. We're calling on everyone to donate good quality, second hand winter coats so they can have a new life and keep another child toasty this winter.

Now that the temperatures have dropped, have you checked whether your child's winter coat still fits? If it doesn't, donate it - and whilst you're at it, maybe you can pick one up in the next size! Let's get winter coats circulating round the city saving waste and money.
