Last year's Leeds Winter Coat Appeal was a huge success thanks to the many businesses, individuals and community groups that got involved donating and distributing coats. 

We were able to give out over 7,600 items of winter clothing to families for free. That saved people over Â£144,000 - money that stayed within the family budget and could be spent on other essentials. The rising cost of food, utilities and other living costs is hitting people hard and it's especially difficult over the cold winter months.

Leeds is a very generous city and we are so thankful that people can and want to help. This year we'd like people to share the winter coats they no longer want or need. It's such a great way to come together as a community and share the things we have. It's good for the environment because it cuts down on the demand for new and it's great for families who don't have to worry about the cost of coats.

This year we are looking for donations of good quality and clean:

* Coats for adults, children and babies
* Waterproofs
* Fleeces
* Baby cot sleeping bags
* Snow suits for babies and young children
* Pram footmuffs to keep babies and children warm in their prams and buggies
* Hats, scarves and gloves

The appeal launches on 21 October 2024 with the final date for donations on Friday 31 January 2025. 

Donations can be made at over 35 public [donation points](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F08UeFw0pxEW2CuWIHKc8UWeDNsFr5tQ/edit) across Leeds. 

All items donated will be available at various [collection points](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wvrv4qIub561Q71WLciZZ1RC5etxzeQl/edit) across Leeds and will be FREE for anyone to take. Please only take one item per family member to ensure there other families can benefit. Resale of the coats is not permitted. All coats will have been distributed by the end February 2025.
