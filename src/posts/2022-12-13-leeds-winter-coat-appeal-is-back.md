Demand has been so high for warm Winter coats this year that we're extending our Leeds Winter Coat Appeal.  

We had such an amazing response last time - collecting 3,600 warm coats that have now been rehomed, saving families around Â£70,000 this winter.  

We're delighted to announce that we are reopening the donations campaign from today, in partnership with Leeds City Council.  This time we're also looking for donations of fleeces and hoodies, as well as warm coats in child and adult sizes.

As before, all donations will be made available in community hubs and designated warm hubs readily available to be picked up by people who need them.  

All we ask is that the items are in good condition, clean and with a functioning zip. 

### Where can I donate a warm coat, fleece or hoodie?
