Building upon the success of our [Leeds School Uniform Exchange](https://leedsuniformexchange.org.uk/) project, we have recently begun work exploring the potential for a similar project focused on sports kit for children and young people.

With funding from [Yorkshire Sport Foundation](https://www.yorkshiresport.org/), we are doing an initial piece of research to get a better feel for whether there may be demand for an initiative that makes it easy for people across Leeds to offer or ask for good quality second hand sports kit - things like football boots or trainers.

Anecdotally, we've heard a lot over the last couple of years -since we started looking into school uniform reuse - that many families struggle to afford to buy the right kit for children to take park in sport or other activities - either at school or at a local club or community organisation.

Not having the right kit can be a real barrier that prevents young people from experiencing all the benefits of getting involved in activities - both in terms of physical & mental health benefits - and the opportunities to learn new skills, meet new people and, most importantly, have fun.

Before we seek funding to pilot some kind of sports kit exchange in Leeds, we'd like to understand more what is currently happening in Leeds, in relation to making it easy for people to give away or ask for good quality kit.

With that in mind, we've got [a short questionnaire](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/SYSGP65) that we're asking local sports clubs if they have something already in place to help people to pass on, or ask for, good quality kit.

It might be something formal - like a stall in reception every now and then - or it might be that informally people are encouraged to pass on kit, for example via a club Facebook group.

Now more than ever we're desperate to ensure that this summer no child in Leeds is prevented from taking part in fun activity because they've not got the right kit.  

We're hopeful that we can help to set something up that, just like our school uniform exchange, taps into the instinctive generosity and desire to support eachother that we know is strong in our city.

You can fill in the questionnaire to tell us more about what happens at your club [here](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/SYSGP65).  Or if you've got other thoughts or ideas [please email us](mailto:info@zerowasteleeds.org.uk).
