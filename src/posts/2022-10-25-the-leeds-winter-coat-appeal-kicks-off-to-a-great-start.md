The 2022 Leeds Winter Coat Appeal launched just two weeks ago and already hundreds of coats have been donated by people across the city. Thank you! 

The cost of living crisis is taking its toll on people across Leeds and we are incredibly grateful to everyone who has dug deep into the back of their wardrobe and donated a coat. \
\
Time and again we’ve seen this is a generous city where people share resources with others - be it winter coats, school uniform or sports kit.  By donating your warm winter coats, you are helping people to stay warm this winter and reduce clothing waste.  

The Leeds Winter Coat Appeal would not be possible without the support of organisations across the city. We want to thank all those that have helped to raise awareness of the appeal, as well as all the organisations that have acted as donation hubs – ensuring that we can collect as many coats as possible.

We are aiming to collect and distribute at least 2000 winter coats. If you would like to donate good quality winter coats in child or adult sizes, [find your closest donation point here](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/projects/leeds-winter-coat-appeal/#map) 

Donations are accepted until Sunday 13th November.
