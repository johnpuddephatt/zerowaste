    "description": "[\\#LeedsByExample on-the-go recycling](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/tips/recycling-whilst-youre-out-and-about-in-leeds-city-centre/) is back! In lockdown we focused on [StayAtHome waste reduction](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/how-can-we-build-back-better-together/) but as our city opens up again, we're promoting once again the benefits of recycling coffee cups, cans and plastic bottles.  \n\n[Leeds truly leads the way](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/leedsbyexample-on-the-go-recycling/) on this - recycling rates tripled from 17% to 49% and it's being rolled out to other UK cities. We'll be building on that success, as well as engaging people on issues relating to recycling and broader sustainability themes with [our #LeedsByExample conversations](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds/?view_public_for=215809088977622).
