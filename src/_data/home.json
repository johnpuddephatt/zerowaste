    "description": "[\\#LeedsByExample on-the-go recycling](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/tips/recycling-whilst-youre-out-and-about-in-leeds-city-centre/) is back! In lockdown we focused on [StayAtHome waste reduction](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/how-can-we-build-back-better-together/) but as our city opens up again, we're back promoting the benefits of recycling coffee cups, cans and plastic bottles.  \n\n[Leeds truly leads the way](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/leedsbyexample-on-the-go-recycling/) on this - recycling rates tripled from 17% to 49% and it's being rolled out to other UK cities. We'll be building on that success, as well as adapting to reflect the times by providing practical support to people and businesses to help them waste less.   See regular updates on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/zerowasteleeds/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZeroWasteLeeds) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zerowasteleeds/)."
