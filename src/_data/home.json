From the grassroots groups gathering in communities to share skills, to the mills where world-leading luxury fabrics are created to the young designers committed to working sustainably, there's so much happening here in Leeds. \n\nWhat could the future hold? And how do we make it easy for people to make sustainable fashion choices? Find out what we're doing as part of #LeedsFashionFutures.",
