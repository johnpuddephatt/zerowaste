    "description": "We’ve launched Leeds Fashion Futures to see how as a city we can reduce the environmental impact of our clothing choices. \n\nIn partnership with the RSA, we’ve been exploring this city's unique relationship with clothing and textiles, its rich heritage, and the talent, creativity and knowledge that exists now.  We've discovered a hotbed of activity, from the grassroots groups gathering in communities to share skills, to the mills where world-leading luxury fabrics are created to the young designers committed to working sustainably.  \n\nCould Leeds lead the way in sustainable fashion? We think so.  We're sharing the many ways to recycle, reuse, exchange and repair clothing & textiles, along with top tips and ideas from the many people we're working with on this project."
