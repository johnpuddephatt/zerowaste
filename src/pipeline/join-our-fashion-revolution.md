We'd like your help to explore what we can do to reduce the environmental impacts of our wardrobes. 

In April last year we hosted an online [Zero Waste Fashion Week](https://www.zerowasteleeds.org.uk/posts/zero-waste-fashion-week-2020/), and we have also developed a [Zero Waste Fashion website](https://zerowastefashion.fashion.blog/) with tips on where to recycle, reuse, repair and upcycle clothing and textiles in Leeds, including a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?hl=en&mid=18ktKdUeew3oQpjOnezeTyLtt9pk1KK7w&ll=53.83676365656107%2C-1.5013154999999188&z=11) of all the textile banks, charity shops, repair shops, sewing classes and clothes exchanges in Leeds.

You can watch a series of interviews with local designers who are exploring how to be more sustainable [on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msp47VGdgyw&list=PLcImqkHEpk0pY2cBDQoVIoptpDNTNN0-B).

We've recently launched an exciting new project, working alongside [The RSA](https://www.thersa.org/projects/make-fashion-circular) to explore what we can do as a city to minimise the negative impacts of our clothing choices. We'll be exploring a range of themes, including what influences our choices around clothing, how we buy our clothes, how we look after them, and how we dispose of them.

If you're interested in sustainable fashion, then please join our [Leeds Fashion Futures group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/leedsfashionfutures).
