Many families in Leeds struggle to afford new school uniforms for their children.

And then there's the environmental cost of lots of perfectly good uniforms that end up getting thrown away - either by the school, who are left with a mountain of lost property - or by parents themselves.

We'd like to do what we can to make it easier for people to offer up uniforms for reuse - and to get second hand uniforms themselves.

To kick things off, we have started to pull together a [map of school uniform re-use schemes in Leeds](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=12f68wxlwJ-MdovH7aQRHCwJyBDkWn-v3&ll=53.79479222009331%2C-1.5229087614461334&z=12), but we need your help! This map is a work-in-progress, so if you know of any school uniform reuse schemes that we have missed, please let us know using this [form](https://forms.gle/TbbcxuSpPPgczCth8).

We also have the dedicated [Leeds School Uniform Reuse Exchange group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/603050533660854/permalink/605410550091519/?notif_id=1593425728610333&notif_t=group_description_change) on Facebook where you can find out what's happening in your area and share any info you have about school uniform reuse in your neighbourhood. Feel free to ask questions or offer  advice in the group too.

We are also working on developing an Inspiration Guide for people who are interested in setting up a scheme - using live examples so you can see how school uniform reuse is working across the city.

We've drafted this [guide](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEEkQESk8Y/view?utm_content=DAEEkQESk8Y&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=embeds&utm_source=link) for how to set up a Facebook or WhatsApp uniform exchange. This is the first draft of our guide - and we're sharing this now to help people to set up a scheme before schools start back in September. Later this year we'll produce an updated version and more guidance for other types of uniform reuse schemes. If you have any suggestions or feedback on this version of the guide please [get in touch](mailto:info@zerowasteleeds.org.uk).

Wouldn't it be great if in 5 years time reusing school uniforms was a normal - and easy thing to do in Leeds?
