Many families in Leeds struggle to afford new school uniforms for their children.

And then there's the environmental cost of lots of perfectly good uniforms that end up getting thrown away - either by the school, who are left with a mountain of lost property - or by parents themselves.

We'd like to do what we can to make it easier for people to offer up uniforms for reuse - and to get second hand uniforms themselves.

To kick things off, we have started to pull together a [map of school uniform re-use schemes in Leeds](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=12f68wxlwJ-MdovH7aQRHCwJyBDkWn-v3&ll=53.79479222009331%2C-1.5229087614461334&z=12), but we need your help! This map is a work-in-progress, so if you know of any school uniform reuse schemes that we have missed, please let us know using this [form](https://forms.gle/TbbcxuSpPPgczCth8).

We also have the dedicated [Leeds School Uniform Reuse Exchange group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/603050533660854/permalink/605410550091519/?notif_id=1593425728610333&notif_t=group_description_change) on Facebook where you can find out what's happening in your area and share any info you have about school uniform reuse in your neighbourhood. Feel free to ask questions or offer  advice in the group too.

We are also working on developing an Inspiration Guide for people who are interested in setting up a scheme - using live examples so you can see how school uniform reuse is working across the city.

So if this is an issue you're involved with - or would like to be - please visit our [Leeds School Uniform Reuse Exchange group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/603050533660854/permalink/605410550091519/?notif_id=1593425728610333&notif_t=group_description_change) on Facebook and add your thoughts, comments and ideas. Or alternatively please comment below or [email us](mailto:info@zerowasteleeds.org.uk).

Wouldn't it be great if in 5 years time reusing school uniforms was a normal - and easy thing to do in Leeds?
